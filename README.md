# NeuralNet
This repo features a two libraries that I have been working on to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in C++. The linalg library is essentially a Tensor library, with an extension that allows 2d Tensors to be manipulated as Matrices/Vectors. The neural library features an easy way to interface with the linalg library for machine learning tasks. The primary object of the neural library is the Model. Models are initialized with an input size and an ordered list of Layers that can be used to create run and train a neural network.

I hope you find the code interesting to read through and run, as it strongly helped develop my own understanding of Neural Networks and the math behind them.
